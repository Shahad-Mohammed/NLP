# Summarize-Talabat-Company-Reviews
The main purpose of this project is to help business owners analyze customer reviews more easily and reduce their burden by making it easier for them to read the results.

In today's business environment, understanding
customers and their needs is crucial for companies to
improve. Especially for delivery companies such as Talabat
due to their importance and frequency of use. One way to
achieve this is by reading customer reviews. However, with
the huge number of reviews, performing them manually
can be a time-consuming and expensive process, leading to
delays in implementing improvements and customer
dissatisfaction.

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), we can
quickly and efficiently develop software for classifying
customer reviews about a company. This software will
identify issues by classifying negative and positive reviews
to help retain satisfied customers. Then, the company can
gain valuable insights into its customers and improve its
services.
The result will be software, based on NLP, that classify
customer reviews of Talabat Company and offer a solution
to the problem of efficiently processing large volumes of
customer reviews
